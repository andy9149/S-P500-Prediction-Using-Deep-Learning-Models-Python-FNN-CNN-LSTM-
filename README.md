## üìò Overview  
This project applies **deep learning architectures** ‚Äî Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ‚Äî to forecast **S&P 500 daily closing prices** using macroeconomic indicators and technical data from **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)** covering 2022‚Äì2023.  

The models were trained, tuned, and evaluated to determine which architecture delivers the **most accurate short-term market predictions**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Collected daily S&P 500 data (2022‚Äì2023) and macroeconomic variables such as CPI, unemployment rate, interest rates, and VIX.  
- Data processed with **Pandas** and normalized for neural network training.  
- Generated lagged features and rolling averages for trend detection.  

### 2. **Modeling**
Three deep learning models were developed:  

| Model | Description | Key Layers |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **FNN** | Fully connected baseline for nonlinear feature learning | Dense, ReLU, Dropout |
| **CNN** | Captures spatial-temporal dependencies in rolling windows | Conv1D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense |
| **LSTM** | Sequential model capturing time dependencies | LSTM, Dropout, Dense |

### 3. **Optimization**
- Hyperparameter tuning using **Optuna** and **KerasTuner**.  
- Batch sizes (32‚Äì128), learning rates (1e-2‚Äì1e-5), and layer depths optimized via cross-validation.  

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Root Mean Squared Error (**RMSE**)  
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (**MAPE**)  
- R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)

## üìä Results  

| Model | RMSE | MAPE | R¬≤ | Notes |
|--------|------|------|----|-------|
| FNN | 62.3 | 1.58% | 0.921 | Baseline neural model |
| **CNN** | **59.5** | **1.36%** | **0.938** | Best-performing model |
| LSTM | 61.2 | 1.49% | 0.930 | Strong sequence learning |

**Key Finding:**  
The **CNN model** outperformed FNN and LSTM, demonstrating superior pattern extraction from lagged input sequences.

## üí° Insights  
- **Macroeconomic indicators** (e.g., interest rate and CPI) significantly influence short-term price movement.  
- **CNN models** are effective for financial data when combined with lag-window feature engineering.  
- Ensemble or hybrid architectures (CNN+LSTM) may further enhance forecast accuracy.  

---

## üöÄ Future Work  
- Integrate **sentiment analysis** from financial news or Twitter data.  
- Extend models to **multi-step forecasts** (weekly/monthly).  
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Plotly Dash**.
